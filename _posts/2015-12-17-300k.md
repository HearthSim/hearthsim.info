## Has it been that long? So many downloads!

18 month since I released the first version of [HDT](https://hsdecktracker.net),
back in May 2014.

Some of you may remember the left side of this image:

In case you don't: yes, that is what HDT used to look like! Crazy, huh?
No importing, exporting, replays, literally six options! It's still far from perfect,
but I would say that's a decent improvement. You can also find the original reddit post
[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/26seey/automatic_deck_tracker_and_more_with_ingame/).

And even before that, [*this*](/media/hdt-devversion.png) is what I personally
used to get to legend that month. Yes, that is the only reason I initially
started this project ;). In case you care, I played zoo!

Fast forward one and a half years, I learned a ton about developing and releasing
applications, got to know a lot of amazing people and HDT has more features
than I can name or count from the top of my head.
It has been an awesome experience and will probably only get better.
I can't wait.

Now to the reason that made me want to make this blog post:

**We hit 300.000 downloads today!** And that's not total downloads but download
for *v0.13.3 only*, which was released five weeks ago. That's so crazy and so
beyond what I imagined when starting this project.

A big thank you to all of you! And especially to everyone who donated, supports
me on Patreon and helped out with the project! Seriously, thank you!

Merry Christmas to all of you!

Alex
