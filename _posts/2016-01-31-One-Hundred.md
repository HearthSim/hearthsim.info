For the first time since its creation, Fireplace has [100% of all collectible cards
implemented](https://github.com/jleclanche/fireplace/commit/79f28dcc4f6eaf4fa919d9cc870aae0b539e06ff).

Did it really take that long? I could have gone the quicker route of focusing on
collectible cards only, but Fireplace had the much more ambitious goal of implementing
everything. Adventures, brawls, everything.

And it's almost there, too!
As of this moment, Fireplace has **1893 / 1945 cards implemented (97%)**. The few that
remain are either unreleased Tavern Brawls or encounter-specific scripting which cannot
be translated to something generic.

I want to thank all the folks over in the
[#hearthsim channel](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=hearthsim). Without all the
helpfulness of the community, I would have abandoned long ago. A special shout out to
@beheh for his contributions on Fireplace itself, and to @Patashu for creating the
Hearthstone Science series that helped the community grow so much.

Big announcements to follow. *Soon*.
