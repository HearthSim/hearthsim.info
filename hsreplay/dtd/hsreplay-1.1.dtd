<!--
 ! An enumValue element MUST always be an integer.

 ! ALL non-root tags accept an optional `ts` attribute which denotes the

 ! The attribute SHOULD be omitted for elements which will never have a
 ! different timestamp than their parent element.
 ! The `ts` attribute on the main Game element represents the time at which
 ! the game started.
 ! Timestamps MUST be in ISO8601 datetime format. If only the time is
 ! available, the date can be inferred from the original file's lastmod or
 ! the timestamp can be saved in ISO8601 time-only format.
