title: Fireplace - Hearthstone Simulator
permalink: /fireplace/
---

**Fireplace** is a Hearthstone simulator, written in Python.

It is the most advanced and faithful implementation of the Hearthstone engine,
including a declarative DSL in Python.

Fireplace ships a builtin [Kettle](/kettle/) server, which lets it communicate
with the real Hearthstone client through [Stove](/stove/), or play games with
the [Joust](/joust/) web interface.
