We are a small community of developers passionate about [Hearthstone](http://playhearthstone.com). We build simulators and other tools around and for the game.

Are you interested? Come join us on the `#Hearthsim` IRC channel on the [Freenode network](https://webchat.freenode.net/).

Our main projects:

 * [Fireplace](https://github.com/jleclanche/fireplace) is a Hearthstone simulator in Python, including a full-blown reimplementation of the engine and cards in Python.
 * [Hearthbreaker](https://github.com/danielyule/hearthbreaker) is a Hearthstone simulator in Python and also implements all the cards.
 * [Hearthy](https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthy) is a Python framework for interacting with the Hearthstone protocol. It includes server-to-simulator communication logic.


Some of our other projects:

 * [HearthShroud](https://github.com/thomaseding/hearthshroud) is an early WIP of an Haskell-based Hearthstone engine.
 * [Soot](https://github.com/mischanix/soot) is an attempt at building a Clojure-based Hearthstone Card DSL and engine.
 * [UnityHook](https://github.com/HearthSim/UnityHook) is a framework for hooking into [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) games' function calls.
 * [CSharp-Proto-Extractor](https://github.com/HearthSim/csharp-proto-extractor) is a [ProtoBuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) extractor for protobufs compiled with [protobuf-csharp-port](https://code.google.com/p/protobuf-csharp-port/wiki/GettingStarted) (which Hearthstone uses)


We also have a low-frequency mailing list on [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hearthstone-simulator-dev). However, development is mostly discussed in the #hearthsim channel.
