We are a small community of developers passionate about [Hearthstone](http://playhearthstone.com).
We build simulators and other tools around and for the game.

Are you interested? Come join us on the `#Hearthsim` IRC channel on the
[Freenode network](https://webchat.freenode.net/), or join our mirrored room [on Gitter](https://gitter.im/HearthSim/HearthSim).

Our core projects:

 * [Fireplace](/fireplace/) is a Hearthstone simulator in Python, including a full-blown reimplementation of the engine and cards in Python.
 * [HSReplay]({{ site.baseurl }}/hsreplay/) is a replay specification, including reference implementations.
 * [Stove](/stove/) is a Battle.net and Hearthstone server written in Go. It is still an early work in progress.
 * [Joust](/joust/) is a web-based Hearthstone client which supports HSReplay as well as real games through Stove.
 * [Hearthstone Deck Tracker](https://hsdecktracker.net) is a deck/replay tracker and collection manager for Hearthstone.
 * [HearthstoneJSON.com](https://hearthstonejson.com/) exports all the card data in Hearthstone to JSON to work with more easily than the raw files.

We also host:

 * [Arena Tracker](https://github.com/supertriodo/Arena-Tracker) is another deck tracker specially built for Arena.
 * [Hearthbreaker](https://github.com/danielyule/hearthbreaker), another Hearthstone simulator in Python.
 * [HearthShroud](https://github.com/thomaseding/hearthshroud), a Haskell-based Hearthstone engine.
 * [Brazier](https://github.com/HearthSim/Brazier), a simulator written in Java with a JSON-based card format.
 * [Soot](https://github.com/mischanix/soot), an attempt at building a Clojure-based Hearthstone Card DSL and engine.
 * [UnityPack](https://github.com/hearthsim/python-unitypack), a Python library for parsing and deserializing .unity3d files.

Our tools:

 * [python-bna](https://github.com/jleclanche/python-bna) is a python implementation of the Battle.net authenticator, usable as both a command-line authenticator and a library.
 * [Hearthy](https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthy) is a Python framework for interacting with the Hearthstone protocol. It includes server-to-simulator communication logic.
 * [UnityHook](https://github.com/HearthSim/UnityHook) is a framework for hooking into [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) games' function calls.
 * [CSharp-Proto-Extractor](https://github.com/HearthSim/csharp-proto-extractor) is a [ProtoBuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) extractor for protobufs compiled with [protobuf-csharp-port](https://github.com/jskeet/protobuf-csharp-port) and [SilentOrbit's Protobufs](https://github.com/hultqvist/ProtoBuf) (which Hearthstone uses)

Resources we work on:

 * [Hearthstone Science](https://www.youtube.com/c/HearthstoneScience), a video series about experimentation with Hearthstone's mechanics.
 * The [Hearthstone Gamepedia Wiki](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/) is maintained by Hearthsim members and includes work such as the [Advanced Rulebook](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Advanced_rulebook)

Everything happens in the #hearthsim IRC channel.
