We are a small community of developers passionate about [Hearthstone](http://playhearthstone.com). We build simulators and other tools around and for the game.

Are you interested? Come join us on the `#Hearthsim` IRC channel on the [Freenode network](https://webchat.freenode.net/).

Our main projects:

 * [Fireplace](https://github.com/jleclanche/fireplace) is a Hearthstone simulator in Python, including a full-blown reimplementation of the engine and cards in Python.
 * [Stove](https://github.com/HearthSim/Stove) is a Battle.net and Hearthstone server written in Go. It is still an early work in progress.
 * [Hearthbreaker](https://github.com/danielyule/hearthbreaker) is another Hearthstone simulator in Python.
 * [Hearthy](https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthy) is a Python framework for interacting with the Hearthstone protocol. It includes server-to-simulator communication logic.
 * [Hearthstone Science](https://www.youtube.com/c/HearthstoneScience), a video series about experimentation with Hearthstone's mechanics.
 * The [Hearthstone Gamepedia Wiki](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/) is maintained by Hearthsim members and includes work such as the [Advanced Rulebook](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Advanced_rulebook)


Some of our other projects:

 * [HearthShroud](https://github.com/thomaseding/hearthshroud) is an early WIP of an Haskell-based Hearthstone engine.
 * [Soot](https://github.com/mischanix/soot) is an attempt at building a Clojure-based Hearthstone Card DSL and engine.
 * [UnityHook](https://github.com/HearthSim/UnityHook) is a framework for hooking into [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) games' function calls.
 * [CSharp-Proto-Extractor](https://github.com/HearthSim/csharp-proto-extractor) is a [ProtoBuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) extractor for protobufs compiled with [protobuf-csharp-port](https://github.com/jskeet/protobuf-csharp-port) and [SilentOrbit's Protobufs](https://github.com/hultqvist/ProtoBuf) (which Hearthstone uses)


Everything happens in the #hearthsim IRC channel. Older discussions are still available in the previous [Google Groups mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hearthstone-simulator-dev).
